## 1.Integrated analysis of scRNA datasets

Integrate single-cell datasets from articles based on filter criteria

## 2.Compare Epi1 Epi2 clusters

Analysis of the composition of two types of epithelial clusters

## 3.cnv patient

Analysis of Single-Cell Copy Number Variations.We excluded cells that were not predicted and the diploid cells that were predicted to be normal epithelial or immune cells. We calculated the mean square and the correlation of CNV per cell with the average of the top 5% of cells from the aneuploid single cells. This allowed us to detect cancer cells and enhance the precision of our findings.

## 4.get epithelial cell

Cells specifically with a correlation or CNV Score greater than 0.2, are categorized as cancer cells

## 5.Calculation of sample EMT scores

Calculate the EM score of each sample based on differentially expressed EMT genes

## 6.EMT differential alternative splicing

Analysis of differential splicing events in CTCs according to EMT classification

## 7.EMT differential AS mode identify

Analysis of modality and premature stop codons in differential alternative splicing events.
